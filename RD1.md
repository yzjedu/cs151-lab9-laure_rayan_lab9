**Objective:**
We were supposed to create seating cards for guests at a dinner party, and output the number of tables needed. Aside from that, we would get practice using for loops, using input and output with files, storing data in lists, and processing those lists.
---------------
**Procedure:**
First, we read the read me file very carefully to make sure we understood the program, and we started brainstorming ways to solve it. Then, we started working on the algorithm, and decided the plan of action we would take then. Once our algorithm was finished, we started coding and took turns driving. During each step that was added, we tested the code we had to catch any errors or adjustments to be made along the way. Once we coded, w realized that we had to change our algorithm around for it to work, but it was fun to troubleshoot. The key concepts we explored were reading files to lists and then processing those lists with for loops.
--------------
**Results:**
Our results matched what we expected to get, but only after having to tweak our algorithm some and look at the formatting of the files to see how it would affect our code. We tried using many test cases including inputs that would give us an error, so we could see how the program would react.
-------------
**Reflection:**
The main challenge we encountered was with printing our seating cards and making sure the formatting was consistent. In order to solve it, we checked the formatting of the files we were reading, and adjusted our code to account for what had been causing the inconsistencies iin our output. We followed the first three steps of programming by spending time attempting to understand the problem and creating an algorithm before we started coding, and testing our program with many different test cases afterwards. I think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab. It helped me understand working with files much better and gave me practice with for loops. It was great working with Rayan and we worked well together. We set up times outside of class to meet and work on the code and it went very well.
