We were supposed to learn problem and solving techniques, using for loops, practcting with files, storing data in lists and proscessing lists. Techniques we used were from class notes in which professor showed us how to read a file. Actually he gave us the code to do it. The key concepts explored were maily just how to process and real files. Results did match what we expected, no test cases. Challenges were within the main fucnction.Our program was outputing a line after every last name in each one of the three files. Just used the frist three steps of programming by working together. Speaking what we thought. Yes I belive we did acomplish what we were supposed to accomplish. Working with Laure was great she was able to help me in many ways. Great person.
